I suppose you have dotnet 8+ and some other stuff installed. Honestly who knows
how this stuff works...

I mostly just want to browse things in Emacs - I think it's basically mandatory
to use Visual Studio to work with C#...

Going to try use LSP mode because holy dam eglot is making me upset.
- Yeah this just works. Eglot can suck a fat one...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun boich/csharp-init ()
      (company-mode 1)    ;; Completion
      (flycheck-mode)     ;; ??
      ;; (tree-sitter-mode)  ;; Start tree-sitter for structural highlighting
      (flymake-mode 1))   ;; Start flymake for on-the-fly syntax checking

    (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'yas-minor-mode)
    (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'lsp-deferred)
    (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'boich/check-lsp-server)
    (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'boich/csharp-init)

    ;; Install fill-column-indicator (this seems to lag like crazy?)
    ;; TODO - I once profiled this and it lagged like crazy. Check if it happens again.
    (use-package fill-column-indicator
      :ensure t
      :config
      (setq fci-rule-column 80)
      (setq fci-rule-width 1)
      (setq fci-rule-color "gray50"))

    ;; If you want to use a specific RGB color, you can use the rgb.txt file that
    ;; comes with X11 as a reference for color names that Emacs recognizes.

    (defun boich/turn-on-fci-mode ()
      "Turn on Fill Column Indicator mode."
      (interactive)
      (when (derived-mode-p 'prog-mode)
        (fci-mode 1)))

    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'boich/turn-on-fci-mode)
#+end_src
