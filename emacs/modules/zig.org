A few assumptions here:
- Zig has been installed.
- Zls has been installed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package zig-mode
    :mode "\\.zig\\'")

  (defun boich/zig-setup ()
    (eglot-ensure)      ;; Start eglot LSP
    (company-mode 1)    ;; Completion
    ;; (tree-sitter-mode)  ;; Start tree-sitter for structural highlighting
    (flymake-mode 1))   ;; Start flymake for on-the-fly syntax checking

  (add-hook 'zig-mode-hook 'boich/zig-setup)
#+end_src

TODOs
- get tree sitter working!
- company-complete suggests things. Bind it to something.
