#+title: Dotfiles and System Configuration

* Summary

This is my dotfiles directory containing all my personalized system configuration for Linux (Ubuntu).

The setup is as follows:
- Clone the repo into a ".dotfiles" folder in your home folder.
- Run the setup-linux.sh script.

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/YaBoich/dotfiles .dotfiles/
cd .dotfiles/
bash setup-linux.sh
#+end_src


* Symlinks

Symbolic links are created for configuration that is supposed to live in the home directory. Such as:

#+begin_src shell
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/emacs/ ~/.emacs.d

# Can view symlinks with:
ls -la ~ | grep .emacs.d

# Or all in a directory with 
ls -la
#+end_src
